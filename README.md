"Uncertainty Quantification for the Hokkaido Nansei-Oki Tsunami using B-splines on adaptive Sparse Grids"

by Michael Rehme,Stephen Roberts, and Dirk Pfl√ºger.
The paper is to be published in the ANZIAM Journal Proceedings of the CTAC 2020 conference held virtually in Sydney, Australia.

We perform uncertainty quantification for a simulation of the Hokkaido Nansei-Oki Tsunami with [ANUGA](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/anuga_core), for which we develop a better understanding by calculating key quantities such as mean, percentiles and maximum run-up. 
The thorough UQ investigation is made possible by an efficient surrogate created with [SG++](https://github.com/SGpp/SGpp).
